<p>Use the “Order of Polynomial” entry window to specify the
order of polynomial to fit to the calibration data. The fit is
obtained in the form x=f(M), as needed to use the calibration to
obtain estimates of a measurand from the output of this sensor. The
red line displays the results from the fit, and the text box below
the plot summarizes the results. Note especially the “Residual
standard deviation” that shows how well the curve fits the data.
This is the error in x and so will be a typical error arising from
using this calibration.</p>
<p>Use the “M=f(x)” checkbox to reverse the order of the fit,
i.e., to regress M as a function of x. See the discussion under “our
solution” for reasons that this is not a good approach.</p>
